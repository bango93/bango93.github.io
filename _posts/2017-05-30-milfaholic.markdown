Hey friends, before you became a member of milfaholic.com website, please read our complete reviews on that site. If you’re already a member of that site and you want to cancel your membership, then please scroll down to the bottom of this page. Believe me, there are only a few [legit dating websites out there](/legit-dating-sites/), but milfholic is not one of them because it is a pure scam site, let me tell you why.

## Milfaholic Display local girls near your area - It is real? ##

Just like we previously [review fuckswipe](/fuckswipe-review/) website, this site also uses similar type of functionality which displays your location based on IP address. So If you’re from NewYork, then it will show “Find Sex Starved MILFs available in New York”. They don’t actually look into the database; they just use your IP location to make that line. And similarly, if any user comes from Texas, then it will display that location instead of Newyork. Such a headline used for marketing purpose, so you signup into that website, and they can collect your email address and later you will get lots of emails message.

## Milfaholic Terms and Policy. ## 

They use automated bots called Fantasy Cuties Program which creates fake profiles. Check out below pictures to read that terms of service.

<img alt="milfaholic bot program terms" class="img-responsive" src="/assest/milfaholic-bot-program.png"/>

That kind of bot will send you automated message so that they can increase sells. And if that message is sent by any bot let’s say Maria for example and if any user have similar name, then it does not mean that original Maria sends that message, they said it is purely coincidental and fictitious. So the messages you have received instantly, after creating a free profile is sent by that bot, and if you try to reply them, it will ask to upgrade your membership.

## Milfaholic Membership Plans. ##

They have a different kind of plans.

<img alt="milfaholic membership plans" class="img-responsive" src="/assest/milfaholic-plans.png"/>

Once you click on any of above plan, you will see a page to enter a credit card details. 

<img alt="milfaholic auto subscription" class="img-responsive" src="/assest/milfaholic-auto-subscription.png"/>

You may still think you’ll be charged only $2.97, but that’s not true. Read the small line on the left side.

*Today's charge is $8.90 for 3 days. Thereafter, membership renews automatically at $34.98 every 1 month until cancelled.*

It means the original charge will be $8.90 + $34.98= $43.88

And read their automatic renewal terms, they will charge your card again and again until you don't unsubscribe.

**So in our review, Milfaholic is not a legit website; first, they use bots to create a fake profile, second, the picture you may see on that site is also fake, third, they may send you automated message from bot, so you signup for premium membership.**

You can’t take any legal action against them because they have written all of the things in their terms of service page. But as we know most of the user don’t read TOS because it is annoying, time-consuming and they use professional words, which ordinary people don’t understand it.
