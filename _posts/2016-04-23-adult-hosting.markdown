title:  "Top 6 Adult Hosting Companies"
permalink: adult-hosting/

Howdy xWebmasters, we all know, before we start creating any website we need two things, first one is Hosting, and second is a <a href="/register-adult-domain/">domain name</a> (like XWebmaster.org), so this post is dedicated about adult hosting. There are tons of hosting companies are available in the internet, but here I created a list of best hosting sites that allowed adult content. **You will get a special discount by using our coupons link :)**

<div class="table-responsive">
  <table class="table">
     <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>#</th>
        <th>Host</th>
        <th>Description</th>
        <th>Coupons</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>1</td>
        <td><a href="http://partners.hostgator.com/c/241354/177309/3094" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Hostgator</a></td>
        <td>Hostgator is my first choice, because it is world’s popular hosting company, and used by many of the webmaster. And yes, they allowed to host adult content. They have also facilities to install WordPress with a single click. So Just <a href="http://partners.hostgator.com/c/241354/177309/3094" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">click here</a> and buy a Hostgator baby plan, I did not suggest to buy Hatchling Plan, because on that plan you can only use single domain name, also the price difference is very minor.</td>
        <td>25% discount - <b>xwhostgator25</b>

		9.94$ Off - <b>xwhostgator994</b></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>2</td>
        <td><a href="http://www.arvixe.com/12492-12-3-39.htm" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Arvixe</a></td>
        <td>Other hosting companies just say, they allowed adult content, but Arvixe has dedicated page to sell adult hosting. Also, they have option to quick WordPress installs, plus you will get, one domain name free for a lifetime (until you used their hosting service) so, you don't need to buy a domain name from  another website. If you're newbie, then I highly suggest to go with them, so you don't need to map your domain name and server.</td>
        <td>20% discount- <b>ARV20</b> </td>
      </tr>
		<tr>
        <td>3</td>
        <td><a href="https://sitevalley.com/clients/aff.php?aff=403&adult" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Sitevalley</a></td>
        <td>May be you believe in OLD is GOLD.  Sitevalley website started their business in 2002 and many of webmaster still using their service. I have also read good review about that. So feel free to go with them, they have also dedicated page to sell <a href="https://sitevalley.com/clients/aff.php?aff=403&adult" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">adult hosting</a>.</td>
        <td>20% discount- <b>ADULTSONLY</b></td>

	</tr>
		<tr>
        <td>4</td>
        <td><a href="https://asmallorange.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">asmallorange</a></td>
        <td>Looking for hosting service who provides top level support? Then try out this host, you will never be disappointed in the lack of support. They said only true, hence they provide a  fixed number of storage and bandwidth numbers. Don’t confuse with limited storage facility, because all other hosts, also provide the same kind of storage/bandwidth facility in unlimited plans.</td>
        <td>15% discount- <b>ASO15</b> </td>

        <td>Has medium traffic? And did not satisfy with above hosts, then try out this host.</td>
        <td><a href="http://www.hostdime.com/blog/category/promos/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Check out their blog</a></td>
      </tr>

Please do not forget to read their terms of condition, before you bought any adult hosting. Yes, all of above webhosts allowed to host adult content, but not all kinds of adult/porn content, like child pornography and rape related. So please read their TOS.
