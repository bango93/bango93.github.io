I am in adult industry since 2011, and do you know guys it is one of the best industry if you want to earn biggest cash online. **It is biggest opportunity to earn money online**. Many of people think there are many of popular website out there, like porn tubes sites and premium porn sites, so why people visit my website, bust trust me guys in adult industry there is nothing about popular, **it is all about porn addiction and your website contents.**

There are many of TGP, Gallery, and Simple WordPress blogs earn thousand of money without doing much work, and they all are getting tons of regular traffic just because people are addicted about their stuff, which is posted on their website. I am handling some of very large blogs, and do you know guys, now my 23% traffic are direct i.e. visitor enter my website URL in address bar, and it is just because visitors are addicted to my content. So here I will tell you how to start your own porn website from scratch, and earn 4/5 figures amount per month.

So here is basic three steps to start any type of website and earn money, this three steps are common to all website including non adult and adult.

1. Setup Your Website
1. Bring Traffic to your website
1. Monetize your website

## Setup your website ##

To setup your first adult website, you need to buy two things 

1. Hosting: Before you buy any hosting, you should to know, whether they allowed adult content or not, here I have created one list about adult hosting, hope you will like it, so choose anything which you like. Hosting charges apply per month, but if you buy hosting in years, then charges will be low.

2. Domain: Hope you already bough hosting, where we can install our website software, not we need to link that hosting to domain. So you can access your website without typing host server address. I have also created adult domain list, hope you will like it. I suggest to buy domain for only 1 year, do not buy for 5 years, once we start earning money then we will renew it for many years, but till now invest only few money. 

**So normally If you start Adult website, I suggest to buy hosting for 6 months and buy domain for 1 years, so the total cost will be around $50.**

Hope you already bought your hosting and domain, now we need to install website software and that is WordPress.

I just loved WordPress, just because it is too easy to use, and do you know guys, WordPress cover 25% markets in internet web i.e. out of 100 websites, 25% website are build under WordPress. Wordpress is contribute by worlds best PHP developer and still they are growing. It is world no.1 popular CMS (content management system) and that's why almost all hosting company provide one click installation facilities. I have also created one post for that, How to install WordPress in your host?, hope you will like it.

Once you install wordpress, start adding great content, and please avoid auto blogging and auto tube scripts.

## Website Traffic: ##

Now a days it is too easy to setup WordPress site in hosting, but bringing traffic to adult website it's tough for most of newbie. **Traffic is money**. The more traffic you will get, the more money you will make it through ads. So Here is list of traffic source links. Hope you will like it.

## Monetization - Earn Money From Your Adult Blog. ##
As I already said, Decent Traffic means Decent Money You will make it from ads, but choosing right Ad network is also necessary, here I share some of best adult ads network, that you may try in your blog.

- Best Adult CPC(PPC) ad network.
- Best Adult CPM(PPV) Ad network.
- Best Adult Popunder ad network.
- Best Adult CPA ad network.
- Best Adult PPL affiliate Network.
- Best Adult PPS affiliate Network.

Don't confuse with too many networks, choose ads network which bring most money to your blog. Do you guys most of people start thinking about monetization before they get decent traffic, but I suggest to don't think about monetization unless you have less than 1000 traffic to your blog. Once you get more than 1000 visitors then start using few ad network for months. Here people also made mistake, they tried our ad network for only few days, but I recommodend to use them for atleast one month.
